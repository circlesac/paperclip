# Temporary chat qualification handoff

Delete this note when the remaining items are fixed or moved into permanent
verification documentation. It is not a release-completion claim.

Updated September 9, 2026. Older scratch checkpoints are preserved in Git at
`f66bedd63`; they are intentionally not repeated as current work here.
The [permanent qualification log](2026-09-08-chat-queue-and-webhook-repair.md)
contains the chronological evidence and failed attempts. The
[browser runbook](2026-09-04-chat-adapters-browser-e2e-runbook.md) remains the
provider acceptance checklist.

## Goal and working boundaries

Finish production-quality Slack, GitHub, Microsoft Teams and Telegram chat,
plus the user's explicitly added Discord connector. Test real conversations,
files/images, interactions, races, queues, reactions, retries and the quality
of the experience. External chat is transport; Paperclip owns tasks, runs,
permissions and audit. Do not narrow completion to whichever tests pass.

- Work only in `/Users/dotta/paperclipai/branches/chat-adapters`, branch
  `codex/chat-adapters`. No additional worktree. Preserve user changes.
- Commit and push coherent verified fixes; do not tend PRs until the features
  work. The wireframe images have already been removed; do not recreate them.
- Root owns Git, live server, ordinary runner staging and signed-in browser.
  Use parallel agents for disjoint implementation or bounded review.
- No filesystem/command approval requests. Only real login, MFA, CAPTCHA,
  tenant/admin or unavailable-secret gates need the user.
- Use the signed-in in-app browser for live provider accounts. A mocked browser
  or successful API response does not establish a good live experience.
- Never export raw reasoning, tool arguments, private logs, credentials or
  private source-file URLs. Never replay `delivery_unknown` without its
  explicit audited resolution.
- One endpoint is one provider bot identity bound to one immutable agent;
  one external thread maps to one task. Recheck current source, reach,
  generation, identity and permissions at every consequential boundary.
- Use a fresh PostgreSQL fixture database for each full integration rerun.
  Never use a test to repair live records or manufacture recovery authority.

## Current deployment

Implementation `739750c15` is pushed, including native recovery, Discord native
forms, Telegram video-note intake and editable Teams validation.
Server **72** is running:

| Field                    | Verified value                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PID / tool handle        | `77253` / `44437`                                                       |
| Listener                 | `127.0.0.1:3137`                                                        |
| Loaded server version    | `2026.831.0+599.git.739750c15.dirty`                                    |
| Started / recovery ready | `05:00:10.725` / `05:00:14.326 UTC`, September 9                        |
| Native runner SHA256     | `6279d39ac731e4565a638b64c93673b8ca23e6dfbc0870e24d48422497f1826d`      |
| Live DB                  | `chat_adapters_live_3103` on local PostgreSQL `55439`, role `paperclip` |
| Last checked runs        | 290 terminal: 262 succeeded, 26 failed, 2 cancelled; zero active        |
| Last new run             | September 9, `02:15:47.812 UTC`                                         |

Both loopback and private Tailscale health returned 200/ready. Public Funnel's
Board-health GET remains 404. Discord Gateway reconnected bot
`1546330979860221952`; its existing endpoint automatically changed modal
capability from false to true. The health response's Git commit is dynamic;
use loaded version and process start to identify deployed code.
The dirty suffix reflects preserved inactive Teams transfer/schema work;
no Teams runtime hook or transfer service was imported at startup, and no new
Teams migration was applied. Server 71 exited cleanly after the fresh
zero-active-run check at 04:59:53.222 UTC. The qualified runner SHA is unchanged.

Private Board: `https://dottas-macbook-pro.tail29c1aa.ts.net`.
Public webhook-only proxy: port `3104` → `3137`; Funnel uses stable port
`8443` (also existing `10000`). Do not expose the Board or files publicly.
Port **3103 belongs to another checkout** and must not be touched.

Passive rejection diagnostics are committed/pushed as `6c5e9c215`. After
verifying zero active proxy connections, root replaced proxy PID 48112 with
PID **27961**, handle **3313**. Log: `webhook-proxy-rejections-0909.log`.
A non-mutating GET through public Funnel at 03:51:14 UTC returned the expected
404 and exactly one closed-label method-rejection record. This proves proxy
deployment/rejection visibility, not provider message delivery. Server 69 was
not restarted during this proxy-only change.

All local runtime material is under ignored
`.paperclip-runtime/chat-adapters-live/`, including:

- `start-server.sh`: configured isolated startup, no embedded credentials.
- `server-experimental-landing-72.log`: current server log.
- `qualified-runnerd-2400740c`: preserved old qualified runner backup.
- `home/instances/chat-adapters-live/runtime/paperclip-runner/durable-sessions`:
  live native roots; do not manipulate historical evidence.

**Build caution:** server `pnpm typecheck` invokes a full runner build and
stages the binary. For source checks use an explicit package TS-only build,
then `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` from `server/`. Root briefly triggered that
side effect, restored exact signed `2400740c…`, and audited no new live runs;
the later `6279d39a…` cutover was deliberate after qualification. Do not
describe the normal binary as continuously unchanged across that earlier check.

## Immediate next actions

1. **Resume real browser qualification on server 72.** Latest actual browser
   inventory reports **Mac locked**; the user has been asked to unlock it.
   Discord login was restored before the lock. Do not request Discord login
   again unless the actual provider page requires it.
2. Repeat same-thread Discord/Slack conversations, queueing and two-file output
   on this deployment. Check transitions, failure copy, final placement,
   reaction cleanup, duplicates and usable returned files, not just final text.
3. On GitHub, exercise the deployed unavailable-file fallback, click its task
   link, and upload the file on that task. Check the correct company, immediate
   chooser readiness and actual usable upload. This complete live journey is
   still unverified; deterministic cases already pass.
4. Continue the remaining browser-runbook permutations. Do not merge or edit
   the disposable GitHub repository while using its PR comments for chat QA.
5. Teams requires an eligible Microsoft 365 work/school tenant and authorized
   Entra/Azure Bot/custom-app setup. Personal Teams login is insufficient.
   Its deterministic tests are not tenant-qualified live proof.
6. Preserve the historical recovery boundaries below. A new conversation can
   qualify new work, but cannot be presented as successful recovery of the
   original failed request.
7. Live-retest the deployed Telegram photo/document boundary and Discord
   normalized interaction denial. Code and deterministic regressions are
   complete; they are not newly qualified live provider journeys.

## Current parallel work and audit conclusions

**New maximal-capability audit, September 9:** the original goal is not met by
documenting every adapter omission as a fallback. Three concrete gaps now own
the next implementation pass:

- **Telegram video-note intake:** the pinned parser produces video attachments
  without filename/MIME, as permitted by Telegram's video-note schema. The
  default policy rejected them before download. A real parser-to-service test
  with a valid MP4 reproduced zero stored files. The narrowly scoped fix now
  binds provider-declared video-note identity to MPEG4 metadata; ordinary unknown
  files remain rejected. Final fresh-database regression: 6/6, including exact
  bytes after restart and current access revocation; adjacent parser/adapter/photo
  checks: 114/114; plain server TypeScript passed before the concurrent Discord
  edits. The new Telegram path is deployed on server 72 but not live qualified.
- **Discord native forms:** v6 now implements native text/select open/submit,
  current source/actor authorization, identical/conflicting duplicate handling
  and actor-scoped private correction/reopen. Existing endpoints automatically
  gain the capability after current runtime qualification. Actual lock-wait
  regressions cover retired/replaced runtimes and changed credential refs.
  Root's final full service run passes **641/641**; seven focused files pass
  **165/165**, including actual discord.js wire serialization. Provider I/O and
  scheduler remain simulated; real modal UI and native continuation still need
  live qualification. A modal submission cannot itself open another modal.
- **Teams personal file output:** existing bot credentials can support native
  consent/upload without new Graph permissions; the pinned adapter does not
  implement the consent callbacks. The new inactive helper/actual-SDK hook
  foundation passes root **81/81**, the owner's egress cohort **119/119**, and
  plain server types. It protects upload capability privacy, exact bytes and
  receipts, and uncertain delivery. The subsequent durable protocol now has
  encrypted early-accept buffering, restart restoration, versioned stage
  resolution and same-transaction projection hooks. Its fresh PostgreSQL
  cohort passes **115/115**, including a reproduced publication/transfer lock
  inversion and a conflicting callback during an owned card send. The original
  81-case foundation did not prove these durable properties. Worker/source
  integration and tenant qualification are still required before activation.
  Channel/group files retain their documented fallback; do not infer broader
  authority.

Root owns shared verification, documentation, Git and deployment. Server 72
loads the committed Discord/Telegram implementations at `739750c15`;
the new native modal and video-note journeys are not live qualified.
Teams durable transfer, schema, safe batch UI/API and optional runtime hooks
are now being implemented in parallel without activation. Root owns shared
service integration and migration review. Browser control still reports Mac
locked. Preserve all parallel edits; no lockfile or PR work is part of this pass.

**In-flight Teams activation checkpoint (after server 72 startup):**

- Durable-transfer owner: new `chat_teams_file_transfers` table and transfer
  service/tests, private encrypted event/capability restoration, early callbacks
  and versioned I/O receipts. Source comment/attachment IDs retain evidence
  without preventing normal deletion; each later effect must recheck the source.
- Runtime owner: optional authenticated consent callback and narrowly typed
  native consent/file-info sends inside the existing regional service-URL scope.
  No service registration or generic Adaptive Card conversion.
- UI/contracts owner: `awaiting_consent`, safe per-part transfer summaries,
  disjoint settled/outcome counts, whole-batch dismissal and version/phase
  preconditions. New fields are additive for rolling compatibility. Missing
  settlement evidence must keep the send identity, not unlock a duplicate send.
- Root next: connect API projections and stage-aware audited resolution, then
  current personal-recipient admission, worker intents/results and restart
  integration. An accepted consent card or PUT is never a published file.

Generated migration `0257_brave_living_mummy.sql` includes the new table,
publication company/ID unique index and `awaiting_consent` CHECK. Root moved
the generated parent unique-index creation before its dependent foreign key.
DB safety/types/build and a complete fresh migration chain passed on
`chat_teams_transfers_schema_20260909_root01`; table and CHECK were inspected.
This has **not** been applied to the live database. It is a passive schema and
protocol slice, not runtime activation. Logs:
`teams-file-transfer-db-build-0909.log` and
`teams-file-transfer-fresh-schema-root-0909.log`. The optional actual-SDK runtime
hook and strictly personal file-card methods pass **25/25**; their seven-file
cohort passes **223/223**. These use synthetic JWT/provider transport, not a
live tenant. The runtime hook stays unregistered until current recipient/source
authority is connected to the worker.

Root's read-only API projections and generic replay/resolution safety guards
pass **19/19** on fresh `chat_teams_projection_20260909_03`. A deliberately
wrong-conversation transfer first reproduced an Activity/batch disagreement;
the exact-scope join fixes it. These are seeded-state API proofs, not native
file delivery. The final UI cohort passes **101/101**, types/token gates pass,
and the two consent-specific browser cases pass **2/2** (13.9 seconds) on fresh
`chat_teams_consent_browser_20260909_03`. Browser publication responses are
mocked; actual task/file-upload controls and reload behavior are exercised.
These targeted runs were followed by the complete current 665-case service
and 31-case browser runs below.

Next integration boundaries are explicit: preserve a minimal authenticated
personal-recipient proof on new Teams deliveries, bind it to the current
processed delivery/principal/conversation generation, supply current source and
permission checks to every file stage, and atomically project real receipts.
The generic publication resolver currently refuses all transfer rows rather
than mislabel a consent card or PUT as delivered; dedicated stage resolution
must replace that guard before the new UI actions are activated. A card/file
send timeout does not prove that the provider request was cancelled.

Passive transfer/schema/runtime foundation is committed and pushed as
`146cf23b9`; server 72 still runs the earlier deployed code. A second standalone
helper cohort now passes root **103/103** on fresh
`chat_teams_projection_20260909_root01`: personal-recipient proof **35**, safe
batch projection **36**, and atomic publication projection **32**. The new
projection records per-attempt intent once, only links the actual final file
card, preserves explicit operator confirmation without inventing a native ID,
and defers affirmative no-I/O failures by 30 seconds. Its combined owner cohort
with encrypted transfer/SDK contracts passes **147/147**. These helpers do not
yet activate file delivery.

The proof validator checks actual pinned-parser personal activity fields but
does not authenticate JWTs or authorize users by itself. Original admission
must supply the verified runtime fence; retained-source checks must bind the
exact causal requester, not select an unrelated newer personal message. The
service's new admission/restart cases pass **3/3** with mocked runtime/transport.
The original normalized proof survives reconstruction exactly, denied reach
redacts it, and a proofless legacy receipt cannot acquire new authority.

Two further genuine worker regressions were reproduced and fixed in the
in-flight service integration: generic publication processing sent a pending
Teams transfer as ordinary text, and its 60-second stale sweep quarantined a
live 90-second Teams intent. Exact company/publication exclusions and a
publication-lock-before-lane-check fix both. The combined API/worker block now
passes **21/21** on fresh `chat_teams_worker_exclusion_20260909_green01`.
The full service run now passes **665/665**, zero skips, on fresh
`chat_teams_integration_20260909_root01` in **125.77 seconds**; the full
deterministic browser run passes **31/31**, zero retries, on fresh
`chat_teams_browser_20260909_root01` in **2.8 minutes**. Logs:
`teams-full-integration-root-0909.log` and `teams-browser-full-root-0909.log`.
The browser loaded the current UI/API work before the later generic-worker
exclusion fix; that worker fix is covered by the final 665-case service run.
Provider transport and model execution remain mocked. New Teams file delivery
is still not activated or live-qualified.

Final service-run source SHA256:
`dbb146cd5cc5494a0cd9026f102ba55f399556caca81d51204e75679e6e845c3`;
integration test SHA256:
`1907518eabc63e73a43489270642404ce7368eb379a9682f5050cdc28a4fa4d0`;
browser spec SHA256:
`d286a6daa1feacde14423044a8a8b0a2324fe217a13ff262313e5eb1648508d4`.
Root additionally passes **44/44** OpenAPI/batch contract tests and **95/95**
selected UI tests; the earlier owner's 101-case UI selection is a different
cohort. Plain server TypeScript and diff checks pass. The dedicated transfer
worker still needs current causal-source/recipient authority, stage resolver,
expiry-recovery scheduling and per-row sweep failure isolation. Do not expose
stage actions with the generic resolver or treat an expired send lease as proof
that no file/card was delivered.

Standalone projection/recipient helpers are committed and pushed as
`e9099b5c4`. The shared service/API/UI activation work remains uncommitted and
preserved. No server restart, live database migration, runner staging or live
provider message occurred during this pass. Lockfile and runner SHA remain
unchanged.

The September 9 browser inventory still reports the Mac lock screen,
not a Discord login failure. Loopback/private health is ready on server 72; the
05:00:24 UTC check has 290 terminal runs and no active run, latest start
02:15:47.812 UTC.
No new live provider conversation has been sent during this audit pass.

Discord's generated question card → parsed concurrent clicks → real service/DB
→ one continuation publication now passes on a fresh database. The Slack
signed `view_submission` bridge passes 10/10; its final callback is a pure
validator/observer. A separate signed adapter/runtime-to-real-service/DB case
now covers invalid submission consuming SDK context, revoked-user denial,
restored operator correction and duplicate no-op. Its three-case database
cohort and 140 adjacent tests pass; root's full 625-case regression passes in
125.87 seconds on fresh `chat_slack_modal_joined_20260909_root01`. The final
test-only teardown adjustment separately passes all three focused database
cases and plain server TypeScript. The case proves one durable
`wake_fallback` receipt and simulated scheduler call, not a native model turn.
Provider I/O and model execution remain explicitly simulated, not newly
qualified live journeys.

The Teams `task/fetch`/`task/submit` bridge found a genuine error-only card that
removed the original inputs and Submit after invalid answers. A frozen repair
rebuilds only current authorized invalid forms with known bounded draft values
and readable question labels. Slack inline errors and all stale/denied guards
stay unchanged. Helper/Teams tests pass 31/31; independent helper/Teams/Slack
review passes 41/41; real-service Slack/Teams invalid-form cases pass 2/2.
The fresh full database regression passes 624/624, zero skips, in 120.61 seconds
on `chat_modal_correction_20260909_root01`; root's helper/Teams/Slack repeat
passes 41/41 and plain server TypeScript passes.
The Teams JWT checker is an explicit test double, not eligible-tenant proof.
The repair is deployed on server 71, with healthy Board and connected Discord
Gateway. No new live provider conversation or Teams tenant proof is implied.

- **Telegram photo eligibility (complete):** bounded PNG/JPEG metadata selects
  photo within supported geometry and a conservative 10,000,000-byte budget.
  Other images retain original document bytes. Header screening never decodes
  pixels. Valid fixtures, malformed headers and exact limits pass through the
  pinned adapter. Ambiguous photo sends are never retried as documents.
  Independent review's JPEG component-header cases are fixed.
- **Webhook diagnostics (complete):** portable tests pass 6/6 and root's actual
  wired-source HTTP tests pass 8/8, including keep-alive, native parser errors,
  privacy, 1 MiB ceiling and the explicit QA fault fixture. Deployed above.
  This closes a diagnostic gap, not the cause of earlier pre-ingress delays.
- **Discord interactions (complete):** real normalization strips raw methods
  used by the old denial check. Runtime-owned context now selects rejection
  after durable denial; foreign-guild actions no longer success-ACK. Forged
  payload markers and concurrent webhook context cannot supply that context.
  Real adapter → runtime → service → DB regressions pass, including one denial
  row and no wakeup for repeated synthetic delivery. Simulated socket/API
  results are not live Discord button qualification.
- **Native reasoning effort (audit complete):** legacy `modelReasoningEffort`
  is not a supported field in the closed native v4 provider contract. The five
  latest succeeded runs freeze `{kind: codex, model: gpt-5.6-luna,
approvalPolicy: never}`. Injecting an effort field is rejected; resolving
  legacy low versus high yields the same native profile. This is a missing
  native capability, not a proved dropped supported setting. A future explicit
  versioned contract addition needs frozen identity, new/resumed turn coverage
  and real qualification. Do not silently map the legacy field or claim low
  effort is effective today.

The latest user reports Discord login restored; root's subsequent browser probe
still reports **Mac locked**. Only the OS unlock is being requested. Root
rechecked server 71 health and the 3104/3137 listeners; no new live provider
turn has been sent during this code-only audit.

## Latest provider evidence — scope matters

Maya E2E `31f56712-3944-423e-b7c7-404bb8fbb993`, company
`7ffa9799-0b1b-4a26-9b44-8e897f832f89`, uses native
`paperclip_runner` / `codex_app_server` / `gpt-5.6-luna`. Terra was not
substituted. Effective reasoning effort is not yet proved; the old configured
low field is outside the native v4 contract. Do not claim it is running low effort.

Real media repeats on server 68 were descriptive, not a controlled speed claim:
Discord run `265d35e0-af1e-421b-b3e2-61ba65fcc288` took 60.073 seconds,
source→last file 64.926 seconds; Slack
`12d6d924-9748-4d13-ad6e-2035937e12dd` took 51.030 seconds,
source→last file 61.173 seconds. Each was sent after the previous run settled
to avoid same-agent queue contention. See permanent log for source/message IDs.

GitHub generic private attachment URLs can be unavailable to the App even when
the signed-in human can read them. Never forward browser cookies or guess file
contents. The new deterministic fallback appends an authorized Paperclip task
link; it does not make those provider files generically downloadable.

Slack once took about 61.5 seconds and Telegram once 234.435 seconds before
local ingestion. Later samples were fast without configuration changes.
Those delays are localized, not explained or fixed. Unauthenticated retry
headers are diagnostic hints, not authority or proof of earlier request paths.

## Protected historical failures

These are not unlocked by the forward warm-transition or startup fixes.
Do not infer full process-tree retirement from a missing PID or leader exit,
clear quarantine, rewrite receipts, reset history or replay accepted output.

Earlier CHA-24 had damaged historical event 44. A Board retry accidentally
selected its older UUID-keyed context and is not damaged identifier-keyed
recovery. Its retired conversation generation must not regain external access.

  Runner PID 69543 retired, but renewed provider retirement is unproved.
  Do not retry the original or failed copy on that fact alone.

## Completed repairs — do not reimplement

- Experimental chat gate preserves production GitHub tools when chat is off.
- Ambiguous outbound delivery has explicit audited resolution; ordinary replay
  refuses unknown delivery. Board send+comment creation is atomic/idempotent.
- Exact failed-run retries derive source/context on the server, preserve the
  admitted batch, dedupe retry intent and recheck current authority. UI surfaces
  use that route; they no longer need a new generic retry implementation.
- Accepted-result presentation is separate from physical session reuse and
  preserves later task state and audit evidence.
- Current-source attachment revocation, native byte-preserving file output,
  media batching guidance, whole-message sizing and truthful status repairs
  have focused and scenario-specific live evidence in the permanent log.
- GitHub unavailable-file task links are durably prepared and reauthorized.
  Task navigation/uploads bind the loaded task's company; outgoing route and
  file-chooser readiness are fenced. Narrow connected-task banners are fixed.
- Warm run handoff has immutable receipt/result/ACK boundaries and final
  activation acknowledgment. Old authority is replay-only. Fresh recovery
  preserves the same lease and requires independently verified server ownership.
- Recovery-only authorization retires only after a fresh exact new-authority
  snapshot. Missing/wrong results and sync/async callback failure keep ordinary
  work fenced, including requests racing bootstrap.
- The event pump is fenced by run identity; local cursors reset after confirmed
  activation. Remote FIN closes the owned WebSocket wire.
- Forward startup ownership receipts prevent unproved relaunches. None of
  these repairs retroactively authorizes historical cleanup.

## Verified automated gates and limitations

On the frozen native candidate: optimized full transport **133/133** (zero
skips, 198.64 seconds), controller **69/69**, optimized Rust lib **248/248**,
and the Codex/native/supervisor/durable integration targets passed.
Root independently passed **26/26** recovery cases, **36/36** generated server
admission, **75/75** adjacent server tests, plus post-format **55/55** selected
protocol cases and **260/260** executor tests. Package TS build/types, direct
server types and Rust formatting pass. Formatting is scoped; some preexisting
files are not globally Prettier-clean.

Generated server admission uses the actual checkpoint rebind and restart
classifier with real PostgreSQL, but mocks the backend after admission.
It is not combined server→real-provider recovery proof. Only local Codex
`resume_dead_runner` with a verified managed/projectless checkpoint is admitted;
surviving-runner, remote/listen and missing-independent-checkpoint cases remain
unsupported and fail closed.

Latest final Discord workflow integration **641/641**, zero skips, ran on fresh
`chat_discord_modal_final_20260909_root02` (123.87 seconds). Root's focused
seven-file cohort passes **165/165** and plain server TypeScript passes.
The first full attempt passed 637/638 because a fixture's unscoped initialization
hook changed the target generation before its own initialization. The hook is
now endpoint-scoped with an exact invocation assertion; the negative capability
assertion is unchanged. Three separate real lock-wait bugs were reproduced and
fixed. Source hashes and exact simulated-vs-live boundaries are in the permanent
log. New Teams durable-integration work is separate and not covered by that run.

The preceding frozen-foundation chat integration **631/631**, zero skips, ran on fresh
`chat_modal_telegram_foundation_20260909_root01` (119.53 seconds). It includes
the Telegram video-note repair and Discord's modal transport foundation with
capability still off, not the subsequent Discord service/correction workflow.
The exact loaded source hashes are in the permanent log. A later test-only
global-collector setup/cleanup correction passes GitHub-filtered **149/149**
(482 other cases filtered) on a second fresh database; this does not change
production behavior. GitHub attachment/stress/setup units pass **182/182**;
the shared Slack/Teams/modal-helper cohort passes **41/41**.

The preceding full chat integration **625/625**, zero skips, ran on fresh
`chat_slack_modal_joined_20260909_root01` (125.87 seconds). A later test-only
nested-cleanup/fixture-retirement adjustment passes the final-source focused
Slack/Teams **3/3** and plain server TypeScript; the full run loaded the prior
semantic freeze, not that cleanup delta.
Root's focused helper/Teams/Slack cohort passes **41/41** and direct server
types pass. The earlier parser/runtime/adapter cohort passed **199/199**.
The full suite includes Slack's signed corrected-modal/database flow,
Teams invalid-form preservation, Discord's parsed
question/denial paths, Telegram photo boundaries, and previous Slack/Discord
partial-file batches across restart and explicit ambiguous-file resolution.
Provider I/O is simulated. Prior log: `slack-signed-modal-full-root-0909.log`
in ignored runtime.

Full deterministic chat browser **29/29**, zero retries (2.8 minutes), includes
six task-company/upload routes and readiness behavior. It is not live provider
qualification. The real-Codex staged startup canary
`paperclip-real-startup-phHTMj` used actual Codex 0.153.4, one provider process
and no model turn; reopen made no new provider RPC. Direct-child exit was
observed, not whole-tree retirement.

Broad workspace tests previously had unrelated harness/runtime failures; never
claim the entire workspace passed from these focused gates. Renew final-source
installation/build/release gates when appropriate; do not substitute PR/CI work
for remaining provider qualification.
